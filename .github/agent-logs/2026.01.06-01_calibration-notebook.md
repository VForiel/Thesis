- Added new notebook analysis/calibration.ipynb outlining Trial & Error (genetic-like), Obstruction, and neural calibration workflows with switches to control runtime.
- Included helper utilities for context creation, null-depth metrics, and comparison tables.
- Added optional lightweight ML training block using existing neural calibration pipeline.

## Files touched
