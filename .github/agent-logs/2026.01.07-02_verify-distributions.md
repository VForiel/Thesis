# Refactor instant_distribution and add verify_distributions

Date: 2026-01-07

## Summary
- Refactored `instant_distribution` to generate numerical distributions only (star-only, planet-only, combined), simplifying plotting and statistics.
- Added optional `return_details` to expose numerical samples, contexts, and OPD errors for reuse.
- Introduced `verify_distributions` that calls `instant_distribution`, computes analytical distributions using the same OPD errors, and plots/prints comparisons.

## Files Modified
- THESIS/src/analysis/data_representations/data_representations.py

## Notes / Testing
- No automated tests run in this commit; changes are localized to data representation utilities.
- `verify_distributions` mirrors previous analytical comparison behavior while reusing numerical samples for consistency.
