# Streamlit thesis pages expansion

## Summary
- Added individual Streamlit pages for projected geometry, temporal response, sky contribution, and noise sensitivity sections.
- Simplified main landing page to describe navigation to dedicated pages.

## Files Modified
- web/main.py
- web/pages/05_projected_geometry.py
- web/pages/06_temporal_response.py
- web/pages/07_sky_contribution.py
- web/pages/08_noise_sensitivity.py

## Notes
- Each new page pulls the shared context panel (VLTI/LIFE presets, RA/Dec/λ/HA) from utils.
- Main page now serves as informational landing; navigation relies on Streamlit sidebar pages.
