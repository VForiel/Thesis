    "## **Breaking the $10^{-8}$ Contrast Barrier: Toward the First Adaptive Photonic Nulling Interferometers for Direct Exoplanet Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quest for Earth-like exoplanets demands unprecedented instrumental capabilities: contrasts exceeding $10^{-8}$, milliarcsecond angular resolution, and stability over hours of observation. We present one of the first implementations of an **adaptive photonic nulling interferometer**, featuring 14 real-time electro-optic phase shifters integrated within a silicon nitride photonic chip, improving astronomical instrumentation through **on-chip wavefront control without mechanical components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This breakthrough instrument combines **Kernel-Nulling interferometry** with **adaptive photonics**, enabling automatic compensation for manufacturing defects and environmental perturbations within milliseconds. Unlike traditional approaches limited by mechanical delay lines and atmospheric turbulence, our **tunable photonic architecture** achieves: (1) **sub-nanometer phase control** with thermal response times under 1 ms; (2) **intrinsic stability**, immune to vibrations and capable of compensating thermal drifts; (3) **scalable integration**, compatible with space missions and large ground-based arrays; and (4) potential **bandwidth adaptability** for spectral diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate **two calibration algorithms** that optimize the 14-dimensional parameter space, retrieving an almost ideal Kernel-Nuller device. Advanced **statistical detection frameworks**, combining multiple kernel outputs, enable robust exoplanet characterization even in the presence of phase aberrations exceeding 100 nm RMS. Numerical simulations for **VLTI/ASGARD and LIFE mission architectures** validate detection capabilities for Earth-sized planets in habitable zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **paradigm shift toward adaptive photonic astronomy** opens new frontiers—from compact space-based interferometers to large-scale terrestrial arrays. Our approach provides the **technological foundation for the next generation of exoplanet discovery instruments**. The potential integration of machine learning with adaptive photonics positions this work at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and fundamental astrophysics, directly addressing the grand challenge of finding life beyond our solar system."

    "- **Transit method**: the exoplanet pass in front of the star and block a fraction of the light. This fraction can be detected by the decrease of the star luminosity.\n",
    "- **Microlensing**: the exoplanet act as a lens and magnify the light of a background star. This magnification can be detected by the increase of the star luminosity.\n",
    "- **Astrometry**: the exoplanet induce a wobble in the star it orbits. This wobble can be detected by the change of the star position.\n",

Thus, as the transmission map is symmetric, we can constrain the planet position to 2 possible locations, on both sides of the star.\n",
